# Unknown
Unknown is a text game in C.


## How to play
It doesn't compile because I'm in the middle of re-organizing all the code.


## Licensing
Unknown is [unlicensed](https://unlicense.org)
and therefore in the public domain.

I just want to develop; I don't want to have to worry about licenses, and I
don't have either the time or money to enforce any licensing terms.


## FAQs
Nothing yet. I'm not one for fake FAQs that look like they're legitimate.
